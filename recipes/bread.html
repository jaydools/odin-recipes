    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>430g <strong>bread flour</strong></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons <strong>instant yeast</strong></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons <strong>course salt</strong></li>
        <li>360ml <strong>room temperature water</strong></li>
        <li><em>optional: cornmeal for dusting pan</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large un-greased mixing bowl, whisk the flour, yeast, and salt together. Pour in the water and gently mix together with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. The dough will seem dry and shaggy, but keep working it until all the flour is moistened. If needed, use your hands (as I do in the video tutorial below) to work the dough ingredients together. The dough will be sticky. Shape into a ball in the bowl as best you can.</li>
        <li>Keeping the dough in the bowl, cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature (honestly any normal room temperature is fine!). Allow to rise for 2-3 hours. The dough will just about double in size, stick to the sides of the bowl, and have a lot of air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 12 hours – 3 days. I usually let it rest in the refrigerator for about 18 hours. The dough will puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 2 days. That’s fine and normal– nothing to worry about.</li>
        <li>Pull out your dough from the fridge and let it sit for 20 minutes before you begin to shape it. This will allow it to rise a bit more. Follow <a href="https://youtu.be/5mehXzl7yHA?t=477"> this video</a> for tips on shaping </li>
        <li>Let the shaped dough sit, uncovered, on the counter for 45 minutes. During this time, bust out a <strong>cast iron cauldron</strong> and preheat the oven to 480°F (with the cast iron inside, lid on). You want to make sure you put your dough in the hot pot.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is hot and your pot is equally as hot, <strong>carefully</strong> take the pot out of the oven and take off the lid. Dust a little cornmeal on the bottom if you like. </li>
        <li>Flip the floaf into your hand, unpside down, and drop it in the pot (gently)</li>
        <li>Cut the top of the loaf with scissors to let the heat escape, allow it to rise nicely and make it look sick</li>
        <li>Dab your fingers in a little water and flick it at the top of the loaf. I find this really helps make a nice crust</li>
        <li>Put the lid on, and pop it in the oven for <strong>18 minutes</strong></li>
        <li>After <strong>18 minutes,</strong> take the lid off and bake for another 25-30mins </li>
        <li><strong>You want the loaf to be dark, crispy and sound like its singing!</strong></li>
        <li>Let it sit for a little bit to cool down, and dig in!</li>
    </ol>
