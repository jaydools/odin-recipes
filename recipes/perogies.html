    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add flour, eggs, oil, salt, and 1 ½ cups of water. Mix well to form a dough, adding more water if needed.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a flat surface for about 4 to 5 minutes or until it becomes smooth and pliable.</li>
        <li>over the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>

       <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ol>    
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 2-inch cubes. Place them in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes for 15 minutes or until fork tender.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, in a medium skillet over medium-low heat, cook the onions in butter until tender without browning.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, place them in a large bowl and mash them. Add onions, cheese, and remaining butter. Continue mashing until the potatoes become very smooth.</li>

        <li>Scoop 1 ½ tablespoons of filling and roll into a ball, place on the pierogi dough. Fold the dough over to form a semi-circle and pinch the edges closed. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat.</li>

        <li>Get a pan rippin and put your bacon in it</li>
        <li>Take the bacon out, dispose of <strong>most</strong> of the bacon fat (keep some in the pan) and cut the bacon into chunks.</li>
        <li> Transfer the pierogies to the hot skillet (adding more butter if needed) and cook until browned on each side, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with bacon and onions and sour cream.</li>
