# odin-recipes
first project
This will be a website that is created from scratch... call it a cyberspace recipe if you will. 
It will encompass the HTML stills I have learned so far. So far I have learned how to set up a html boilerplate, how to create headings, how to create body, how to format body text in bold and italics, insert internal and external page links, internal and external images and thats basically it!
